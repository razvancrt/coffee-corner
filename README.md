ASSUMPTIONS I MADE:
- for the 5th beverage I used the reduction price of 1 medium coffee to keep it simple (because for example in case of 2 smalls and 3 large coffees I don't know which one is the 5th)
- for the beverage+snack extra for free I used the first extra from the beverage to reduce the price (even if there can be multiple extras for one beverage)
